        linear gradient:
            It accepts 2 values or more, and 2 values are mandatory. 
            Basically this is used for combination of background 
            colors.

        Whenever we want to use linear and radial gradient, we need 
        to maintain background-image or backgroud.

        Radial Gradient:
            It accepts 2 values or more, and 2 values are mandatory. 
            Whenever we mention radial gradient, it'll give us 
            ellipse like structure.

        Float:
            We use the float property where our elements should be float. 
            It is also having 2 values of left and right.

        Clear:
            Whenever we use the float property and we want the next 
            element below (not on left or right), we have to use clear 
            property. It specifies what should happen the next element 
            which it next to a floating element.

        Box-sizing:
            It's having 2 things and it specifies how the width and 
            height of the element should be calculated whether to include 
            the padding or borders or not.
    
            Content Box:
                The width and height prpperties includes only the content 
                border and padding are not included 
            
            Border Box:
                The width and height properties includes content,padding 
                and border.

            Content Box-> width=width of the content and height=height of
            the content (borders and padding are not included) 
    
            Border Box->Width=border+padding+widh of the content and 
            height=border+padding+width of the contents
    -->
    <div class="box1">Box1</div>
    <div class="box2">Box2</div>
    <div class="box3">Box3</div>
    <div class="box4">Box4</div>
